			We need to keep your email in order to provide you with your forgotten password. If you complete also your personal data, these will be kept in our database and destroyed at your request. All of this data will be kept as long as you are registered with us.

		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p> You will be able to change your public name displayed to other users in your profile. Your Whasqs and answers will be preserved anyway (anonymously if you asked to delete your account). If you are OK, VALIDATE and go to live the WHASQ adventure.
